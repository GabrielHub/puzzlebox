# Personalized PuzzleBox Webapp
A narrative driven puzzlebox that was personally designed based on a user's theme!

## Theme

**Design Statement:**

	We were given thematic elements and the current interests of the user we were designing the puzzlebox for. We decided on an Underwater Reasearch Facility, that was overrun by a Rogue AI. We could use this theme to create different solver roles and promote collaboration. One of the primary goals of this project is to encourage collaboration between players/solvers. Our method of achieving this will be to assign different people unique roles which receive different kinds of information. Solvers would be required to combine the information they are given and solve problems together. Additionally, we want to create an atmosphere of creeping dread without getting too dark. Some of the text used in the puzzles (particularly in emails planted between characters in the story) will be intentionally lighthearted, documenting day to day life of the crew members at the bottom of the ocean.

**Premise:**

	Agnes Wants To Die is set in the near future of 2049, at the bottom of the Atlantic. The desired tone was light-hearted and cheeky, but with dark undertones. Three researchers in the underwater base (Marine Biologist, Computer Scientist, Mechanical Engineer) are trapped by their AI assistant, Agnes. You are here to help the researchers escape, by first hacking into their email database where all their conversations are recorded.

**Structure:**
	
	* Map puzzle gives you the answer “heartB06”
	* Chess puzzle gives you the answer “BEATNc2”
	* Riddles / Crossword give you the answers “aiisalone”
	* Algorithm puzzle kills the AI and wins it

The original box was sent with a document of the printed email puzzles, a physical chess set, and the crossword/riddle puzzle and specimen profiles printed.
