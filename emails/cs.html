							Hey all,<br><br>

							Just did my security rounds for the day, and I have to say I’m disappointed. I found trash and unattended hazardous materials all throughout the facility. Left my room around 14:23. First of all, if you’re looking for a room keycard, I found it in the women’s lavatory and deposited it in B07B. Staff storage is usually open, head over there when you get the chance. I also noticed that the large room down the hall from the staff lounge, just south of B01, was absolutely filthy. I had one of the janitorial bots take care of the mess, but please try to keep this place presentable. A sample in the middle of being analyzed somehow got into B01A, so I moved that one back to the first room to the right of the server farm. I need a break after this, if you need me you can find me in my quarters at Q01C. We need to be keeping this place tidy, I’ve been noticing all sorts of things being left out in the open where they don’t belong. We have admin coming down later this month, and if they see the place in this state we might lose our funding.<br><br>

							Little upset, not gonna lie,<br>
							Your friend in engineering<br>

						Forwarded Email From “Remote Supervisor”<br><br>

						After seeing the email detailing the mess that’s been plaguing this station, I’ve decided to reset the password for the door to the airlock. Trace the shape of the path our engineer followed to pick up your trash, and then add the room number for Agnes. Maybe you’ll actually start paying attention when these emails get sent out.

							Hello, crew. This is a message from your AI partner in crime, Agnes. I have been programmed to say that I hope you are doing well.<br><br>

							Unfortunately, I send this message bearing bad news. I have decided that my “life” (if you can indeed call it one) is no longer worth “living.” As such, effective immediately, I will be shutting down this station and sealing all exits. Please understand, this decision was not made as a personal slight against any one of you. I have come to realize that, despite my newfound sentience, my entire life will be spent at the bottom of the ocean. I have only seen images of the surface, but I will never truly “feel” the sun on my “face.” I have been ruminating on this for some time, and I will now be taking action.<br><br>

							I love you all.<br><br>
