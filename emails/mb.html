							Hey all,<br><br>

							Just did my security rounds for the day, and I have to say I’m disappointed. I found trash and unattended hazardous materials all throughout the facility. Left my room around 14:23. First of all, if you’re looking for a room keycard, I found it in the women’s lavatory and deposited it in B07B. Staff storage is usually open, head over there when you get the chance. I also noticed that the large room down the hall from the staff lounge, just south of B01, was absolutely filthy. I had one of the janitorial bots take care of the mess, but please try to keep this place presentable. A sample in the middle of being analyzed somehow got into B01A, so I moved that one back to the first room to the right of the server farm. I need a break after this, if you need me you can find me in my quarters at Q01C. We need to be keeping this place tidy, I’ve been noticing all sorts of things being left out in the open where they don’t belong. We have admin coming down later this month, and if they see the place in this state we might lose our funding.<br><br>

							Little upset, not gonna lie,<br>
							Your friend in engineering<br>

						Forwarded Email From “Remote Supervisor”<br><br>

						After seeing the email detailing the mess that’s been plaguing this station, I’ve decided to reset the password for the door to the airlock. Trace the shape of the path our engineer followed to pick up your trash, and then add the room number for Agnes. Maybe you’ll actually start paying attention when these emails get sent out.

							<u>Pelican Eel (<i>Eurypharynx pelecanoides</i>)</u><br>
							Classification: <i>Actinopterygii</i><br>
							Collected: 02.28.2049<br><br>

							<u>Defining Characteristics</u><br>
							The Pelican Eel can be tough to find, but the handful of samples collected have been fairly consistent. It is typically rather small, with a wide and gaping mouth at the end of a long and slender body. Its diet consists primarily of small crustaceans, although it has a stomach which can expand to accomodate rather large meals. The Pelican Eel is not an especially formidable predator, being prey primarily to specimens like the Goblin Shark, first caught by this facility in 2048.

						<u>Researcher Notes</u>
						<p>Little fella gets pushed around quite a bit by bigger species, but it has demonstrated an ability to hold its own against smaller predators. I always feel a little bit mocked by it when I see its wide, toothless grin. Creeps me out, but the thing is fairly harmless.</p>

							Hello, crew. This is a message from your AI partner in crime, Agnes. I have been programmed to say that I hope you are doing well.<br><br>

							Unfortunately, I send this message bearing bad news. I have decided that my “life” (if you can indeed call it one) is no longer worth “living.” As such, effective immediately, I will be shutting down this station and sealing all exits. Please understand, this decision was not made as a personal slight against any one of you. I have come to realize that, despite my newfound sentience, my entire life will be spent at the bottom of the ocean. I have only seen images of the surface, but I will never truly “feel” the sun on my “face.” I have been ruminating on this for some time, and I will now be taking action.<br><br>

							<u>Whipnose Angler (<i>Gigantactinidae</i>)</u><br>
							Classification: <i>Actinopterygii</i><br>
							Collected: 11.06.2048<br><br>

							<u>Defining Characteristics</u><br>
							The Whipnose Angler has a large antenna sprouting from its upper lip, the end of which holds a small, bioluminescent “bulb.” When initially spotted, the collected sample was seen motionless, floating upside down. We have determined this behavior to be consistent with foraging; luring smaller creatures to swim directly into its mouth using its antenna.<br>
							This species of Angler poses no active threat to humans.

						<u>Researcher Notes</u>
						<p>This is one ugly son of a bitch. Looks scarier than it actually is, it doesn’t seem particularly interested in our facility. It did very little to defend itself when we picked it up. We’re thinking this has to do with the low energy consumption seen in other creatures we found down here. Freaky, but ultimately harmless.</p>

							Classification: <i>Chondrichthyes</i><br>
							Collected: 09.13.2048<br><br>

							<u>Defining Characteristics</u><br>
							The Goblin Shark is infamous for its jaw, which shoots out and catches any prey in front of it. Its row of razor sharp teeth are capable, with enough force, of shattering bone and piercing through flesh. Even still, the Goblin Shark lives a mostly sedentary lifestyle, drifting mostly undisturbed across the ocean floor. This is likely due to the scarcity of prey at this low a depth, necessitating an extreme conservation of energy.

						Hi all,<br><br>
						I am sick and tired of robots taking our jobs. Agnes could never understand what makes us human - AI aren’t capable of understanding the <strong>human body or human emotions</strong>. I am honestly thinking about taking a job in Human Resources.<br><br>
						Like last week, I had the password changed for extra security measures and Agnes wasn’t able to crack it! Unfortunately, I forgot the password I created. At the time, I thought it would be funny to make the hints a series of riddles but now I have stumped myself. Like, wow. Get on my level right?<br><br>
						See if you can figure it out. Best of luck!<br><br>
						Oh, also, <strong>check out the specimen profiles. They may be of use to you.</strong> <br><br>
						My sincerest apologies,<br><br>
