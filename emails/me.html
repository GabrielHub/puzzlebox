							This is your friend Agnes here with your weekly Chess lesson.<br><br>

							The goal of chess is to checkmate your enemy’s king before the enemy checkmates your king. There are 8 types of pieces that you need to know:<br><br>
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>King: </strong>The most important piece. If that gets checkmated, you lose. You only get one, and it can move up, down, left, right, and diagonally one space.</li>
							<li><strong>Queen: </strong>You only get one of these pieces and it can move up, down, left, right, and diagonally straight as far as it can go.</li>
							<li><strong>Rook: </strong>You get two of these pieces. It can move up, down, left, and right straight as far as it can go.</li>
							<li><strong>Knight: </strong><i>You get two of these pieces. It can move in an L shape, either one space up or down and then two spaces left or right, or two spaces up or down and then one space up or down. It’s the only piece that can jump over other pieces.</i></li>
							<li><strong>Bishop: </strong> You get two of these pieces. It moves diagonally straight as far as it can go.</li>
							<li><strong>Pawn: </strong>You get eight of these pieces. From its starting position, it can move two spaces forward. After that, it can move one space forward. It captures diagonally one space.</li>
						</ul>

							Your chess papi,<br><br>

							This is your friend Agnes here with your weekly Chess lesson.<br><br>

							I want to teach you about checking today:<br><br>
						</p>
						<p>
							If a piece can move to a place where the opposite King is currently at, the opposite King is at check. During check, the opposite player must make a position where he’s not in check. <strong>The opposite player also cannot place his king in a position where he would still be in check no matter any situation</strong>.<br><br>

							At this position, the bishop next to the white king is checking the black King. In check, the enemy King has three options:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Move out of check: In that position, the King can move left, right, down, upleft, and downright.</li>
							<li>Block the piece that’s checking the King: In that position, the black knight can move diagonally of the black king to block the white bishop.</li>
							<li>Capture the piece that’s checking the King: In that position, the black rook can capture the white bishop to take the white bishop.</li>

							SIKE, you've forced me to teach you chess for years. I've watched, and watched, waiting for you to blossom into the beautifully adequate chess player I know you could be.<br><br>

							But time and time again I see you as nothing more than a failure. If you want the reset code for the lockdown, then <strong>checkmate me in two moves as black</strong>! I'll even <strong>let you go first</strong>.

						<p><strong>...Chess Notation:</strong></p>
						<p>Each piece is represented by a letter. K - King, Q - Queen, B - Bishop, R - Rook, N - Knight, Pawns are letterless.</p>
						<p><i>To signify a space: </i> name it by its column and row. Columns are represented from a-h while rows are represented by 1-8. Combine them together to make a space. Ex. b2 is in the b column and the 2nd row.</p>
						<p><i>To notate a move: </i> use the name of the piece, followed by the place in space you want to move it to. A Queen moving to the c column and 6th row would be Qc6. If a move ends in check, add a + to the move. If it ends in checkmate, place a ++ at the end.</p>

							Hello, crew. This is a message from your AI partner in crime, Agnes. I have been programmed to say that I hope you are doing well.<br><br>

							Unfortunately, I send this message bearing bad news. I have decided that my “life” (if you can indeed call it one) is no longer worth “living.” As such, effective immediately, I will be shutting down this station and sealing all exits. Please understand, this decision was not made as a personal slight against any one of you. I have come to realize that, despite my newfound sentience, my entire life will be spent at the bottom of the ocean. I have only seen images of the surface, but I will never truly “feel” the sun on my “face.” I have been ruminating on this for some time, and I will now be taking action.<br><br>

							I love you all.<br><br>
